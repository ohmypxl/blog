I feel like contributing something by making it easier is hard, i need to deal with random error, bullying, etc etc. So i've decied to just nuke unused project and start fresh! ðŸ˜„

It would be filled with private stuff from now on, i didn't nuke archived project since it's important to keep it alive. I also want to take a break to just learn more about what i'm doing before asking shit about everything i dont know because turns out learning the subject first is required before asking related subject.

Sorry if i wasn't actively posting the blogs since i kinda busy with work and stuff, hopefully i will do my best on the future.
