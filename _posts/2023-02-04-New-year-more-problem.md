Firstly i'd like to say Happy Very Late New Year for those people who are celebrating it, me however doesn't feel liking it since the years just changed to one digit and i'm still doing my usual task which is doing absolutely NOTHING. But this is where it started more problem than last year, I've been busy trying to maintain my both linux and windows together but i really can't do it. So, i just purge everything again and went fresh today.

Windows 11 reinstalled and also reinstalled arch too but this time i used Qtile as my WM and no DE. I don't know DE these days is heavy and makes my development progress really slow since i have to maintain the window and stuff, unlike in WM only where i don't have to care about these stuff since
it's already managing it for me.

Now, more problem are comming into my radar, my project haven't finished yet, somehow my compiler is fucked, need to think again about my structure and yeah i'm really fucked now. But don't worry those problem will go soon (i hope) and hopefully i can get really chilling stuff at next year!.
