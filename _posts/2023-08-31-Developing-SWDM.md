Hello, long time no doing blogging stuff, i just recently setting up this blog to tell you some story how i ended up developing SWDM with my friend [@equinnoxy](https://github.com/equinnoxy). First i want you to know what is SWDM, so basically SWDM means Secret Weapon Death Match, a SA:MP server developed by me and equinnox when we heard the news about the recent news that the Indonex server was going to be taken down by one of the developer called SOUHEI. At first it was just a joke about me told eq to make a DM server for an alternative server just in case if the indonex server is going to be down and that idea is getting accepted well betweeen him and his community. At first we didn't know what we're doing until SOIHEI himself decided to help equinnox how to setup a server, and then ended up using the Kokys DM as our bases due to him(equinnox) want to make the server ASAP because he thought it would be too late if we didn't launch now. That's the story how i ended up developing with him.

It was fun experience nonetheless, getting more experience how can i do stuff here and there and learning how to do collaboration with someone. Even though i ended up getting scolded by him because i was messing with his progress hahahahaha.
