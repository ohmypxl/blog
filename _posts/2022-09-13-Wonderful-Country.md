# Wonderful Country

I don't know how this country can be so bad at securing our data, but recently this country Indonesia have been targeted by some hacker, but our citizen it's so smart that they're willing to sacrifice their data for the hacker to act like a Robin Hood.

(If you don't know anything about robin hood, you can look at [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hood))

People think that we should thank to the hacker for the data breach, i don't see any reason why we should thank to someone who sell our data though, it's just weird if we keep thinking about it. I just don't have any problem with him leaking anything he wants, but thanking him??? nahh mate i'm not into that.

And also i don't care about what the hacker might doing because the only thing matters for me is "How fucked up our govt right now", yes they're in a real situation where it proved our security isn't that great unlike other country.
They should be the one who is responsible for the leak, and i want them to think how they can fix this instead of keep throwing the case and blame it to others or just says "Pls hacker stop attack us :cryemoji:" or "ok bois we going to catch him but how?"

Dumbass, why you taking that priority first, what did you gain from arresting the hacker in the first place? you should be the one who prioritising the security enhancement and taking care of our data from any hacker in the future.
Don't just come out giving new cards, we have enough of your stupid cars. Do something man!
