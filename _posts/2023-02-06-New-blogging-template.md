Welcome to new blogging template or should i say new blogging style made by [Cotes Chung](https://github.com/cotes2020). First time i saw this style on github i was feeling amazing about the design and style he puts into this and also he made it available for me to use too in github pages!. At first i find it too painful to configure stuff but luckily i can manage to do it in my own local environment, meaning i will try to minimize stupid mistake that still relies on github pages in order to see the changes, yaay! ðŸ˜„.


Hopefully with this, i don't need to change anything else in the future but well, we never know xD.
Anyways, enjoy the new blogging design and thank you so much for Cotes for making this available for github pages.
