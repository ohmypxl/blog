This blog is created for my personal OSS-Blogging site to share anything i know to public including sharing my Development Progress, Tips and Trick, some cool things i found, etc. Mostly i will talk about pawn or android, with or without bahasa indonesia but i will try my best to write it with english most of the time so you can still see what i'm posting on my blog. 


Originally this blog was meant to my telegram but i've decided to be my personal blog instead because i want to share many things with you all plus making the website fully forkable for people who want to use it.
