# PxL's Open Source Website

Umm yeah this is created for my personal OSS-Blogging site to share anything i know to public including sharing my Development Progress, Tips and Trick, some cool things i found, etc. Mostly i will talk about pawn or android, with or without bahasa indonesia but i will try my best to write it with english most of the time so you can still see what i'm posting on my blog.
